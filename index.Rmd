### I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

### Add some links

I like Google. Note that the specific syntax for making something appear as a link is [ ] brackets.
Example: I like [google](https://www.google.com). 

I like [to look for code on the internet](https://wwww.google.com). 

### Common content - embedding images

Note: Jeff usually makes a folder that will contain all the images we want to put online. 
Also, this is probably the only case where he messes with HTML rather than add images using the R markdown. 

Add an image on my own: 

<img src="./images/mem_day.jpg" style="width:75%"> 

Note that without the ./ to denote current working directory works also. 

Also note that to get the "Build" tab, we need to restart RStudio.
