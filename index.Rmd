### I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

### Add some links

I like Google. Note that the specific syntax for making something appear as a link is [ ] brackets.
Example: I like [google](https://www.google.com). 

I like [to look for code on the internet](https://wwww.google.com).
