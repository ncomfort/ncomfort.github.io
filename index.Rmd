## Hi, I'm Nicole

My name is Nicole Comfort. I was born and raised in Middlesex County in Massachusetts and so am an obnoxious New England sports fan by default (Go Sox!). If I'm not wearing Boston sports T-shirts, you'll find me in some free swag I got in college. In 2015 I graduated from Northeastern University (Boston, MA) with a B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience.

I come from a big, loud family and like to visit them as much as I can!

On the first day of fall this year, I got engaged to my best friend and boyfriend of ten years. I must say, wedding planning is fun but awfully distracting from school and research!

My research interests are: 

## Oh, and I'm a dog mom
