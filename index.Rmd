### PhD Candidate
### Environmental Health Sciences
#### Mailman School of Public Health
#### Columbia University

<br> 

Nicole received a BS in neuroscience from [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/) in 2015. She is currently working at the [Laboratory of Precision Environmental Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/laboratory-precision-environmental-health) under the mentorship of Dr. [Andrea Baccarelli](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ab4303) to study extracellular vesicles as biomarkers of environmental exposures and disease.

Her research generally involves the analysis of RNA-sequencing data. Recent projects have focused on a longitudinal transcriptomic characterization of aging sciatic nerves in sarcopenia and on plasma extracellular vesicle microRNA as biomarkers of cognitive decline in a cohort of elderly men in Boston, MA. 

In her spare time, Nicole enjoys walking her two dogs, playing video and board games, traveling, dining out, and painting. You can check out some of her commissioned pet portraits here.
