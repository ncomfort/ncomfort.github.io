## Hi, I'm Nicole

My name is Nicole Comfort. I was born and raised in Middlesex County in Massachusetts. In 2015 I graduated from Northeastern University (Boston, MA) with a B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience. 

## I'm a PhD student

Add research interests.

I like Google. Note that the specific syntax for making something appear as a link is [ ] brackets.
Example: I like [google](https://www.google.com). 

I like [to look for code on the internet](https://wwww.google.com). 

## Oh, and I'm a dog mom

Note: Jeff usually makes a folder that will contain all the images we want to put online. 
Also, this is probably the only case where he messes with HTML rather than add images using the R markdown. 

Add an image on my own: 

<img src="./images/mem_day.jpg" style="width:75%"> 

Note that without the ./ to denote current working directory works also.
