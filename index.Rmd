Dr. Comfort received her B.S. in neuroscience from [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/) and her Ph.D. from Columbia University in the [Laboratory of Precision Environmental Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/laboratory-precision-environmental-health) under the mentorship of Dr. [Andrea Baccarelli](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ab4303). Her dissertation work focused on the study of [extracellular vesicles](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2017.125) as biomarkers of environmental exposures and disease. 

Building on this work, Nicole is currently completing her postdoctoral training under the mentorship of Dr. [Diane Re](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/dr2240), studying central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles as novel biomarkers of metal exposure and disease progression in the context of the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 

In her spare time, Nicole enjoys walking her two dogs with her husband, playing video and board games, traveling, dining out, practicing yoga, and painting. You can check out some of her commissioned pet portraits [here.](paintings.html) She is also passionate about advocating for environmental and public health and promoting STEM among under-represented groups.
